description: Meet Gypsum, the DeFi Protocol for staking and earning rewards
full_description: Gypsum is an open source DEFI project focused on sustainable yield. it is a deflationary token, On every transaction, 5% of the tokens in the transaction are burned permanently and the other 5% is distributed towards stakers.
This is done to increase the value of each Gypsum token over time. The more tokens you stake, the more fees you will earn, this is the reason why there is no fixed APY.
